# Anaconda Documentation

Anaconda Individual Edition is a Python/R data science distribution and a collection of over 7,500+ open-source packages, which includes a package and environment manager. Anaconda is platform-agnostic, so you can use it whether you are on Windows, macOS, or Linux. Anaconda is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support.

## Why do I need Anaconda Distribution?

Many scientific packages require a specific version of Python to run. It’s difficult to keep various Python installations on one computer from interacting and breaking, and harder to keep them up-to-date. Anaconda Distribution makes management of multiple Python versions on one computer easier, and provides a large collection of highly optimized, commonly used data science libraries to get you started faster.

## What is Miniconda?

Miniconda is Conda and its dependencies. With Miniconda, you can build your environments from scratch by installing only the packages needed to run the Conda command. It’s a much smaller installer, typically used with an active internet connection. `conda install PACKAGENAME`.

Example: `conda install anaconda-navigator`

See full documentation for Anaconda Distribution: docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/

## Will it work on my machine?

Anaconda Distribution is available for Windows 7 and newer, macOS 10.10 and newer, or any Linux distribution with a glibc version greater than 2.12 (CentOS 6). Anaconda requires 3GB of free hard drive space, while Miniconda needs only 400 MB.

## Anaconda Navigator

## What is Anaconda Navigator?

A graphical interface for launching common Python programs without having to use command lines. It can also be used to install packages and manage your environments.

## Will it work on my machine?

Anaconda Navigator is available for Windows, macOS or Linux. Navigator is automatically installed with Anaconda Distribution.

Follow the graphical install instructions: docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install

## Open Anaconda Navigator

On Windows, the installer will create a Start menu shortcut for Navigator. On macOS, if using the GUI (.pkg) installer, you’ll get an icon for Navigator in Launchpad. On Linux or macOS installed via .sh installer, open a terminal and enter this command: `anaconda-navigator`.
